# Cisco Security Compliance Assistant

## Overview
The Cisco Security Compliance Assistant is a Streamlit-based tool designed to evaluate Cisco device configurations against STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guide) standards. The application leverages language models, a vector store for STIG data, and advanced text processing to provide a detailed security analysis and configuration remediation.

- **STIG Integration:** Utilizes a CSV-based STIG database (or embedded data) to retrieve security requirements.
- **LLDP Parsing:** Optionally processes LLDP information to enrich network topology details.
- **Automated Recommendations:** Generates a fixed configuration with inline comments, highlighting changes and improvements.
- **Comparison Tools:** Displays unified diffs and side-by-side comparisons for clear visibility of modifications.
- **Downloadable Reports:** Export the fixed configuration and a complete security report.
